App Store Description
Short Description (for search results):
Document on-call triage encounters quickly and securely. AI-powered parsing, fully offline, HIPAA-conscious design.
Full Description:
OnCall Scribe helps physicians document patient triage encounters during on-call shifts — quickly, securely, and entirely on-device.
THE PROBLEM
On-call doctors receive triage messages from answering services as poorly formatted text blobs. These messages have inconsistent spacing, abbreviations, and missing delimiters. Documenting each encounter means manually extracting patient details while half-asleep at 2 AM, with no good way to search your history or generate handoff reports.
THE SOLUTION
Copy the triage message, paste it into OnCall Scribe, and let on-device AI parse it into structured fields: patient name, callback number, date of birth, attending physician, and chief complaint. Add your clinical advice and disposition, then save. That's it — 30 seconds per encounter.
KEY FEATURES

AI-Powered Parsing — Uses Apple's on-device Foundation Models to intelligently extract patient data from messy answering service messages. No internet required.
Specialty Customization — Configure for your specialty (OB/GYN, Pediatrics, Cardiology, Psychiatry, Family Medicine, and more). The app adapts terminology, disposition options, and parsing rules to match your practice.
Search Everything — Full-text search across all records. Find any patient, any complaint, any date instantly.
Shift Handoff Export — Generate formatted triage logs for any date range and share via email, text, or any app. Perfect for end-of-shift handoffs.
100% Offline — No account required. No cloud sync. No data ever leaves your device. Works in airplane mode.
Privacy by Design — All data stored locally with iOS encryption. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party SDKs. Your patient data stays on your phone.

DESIGNED FOR REAL ON-CALL USE

Dark mode optimized for nighttime use
Large tap targets for one-handed operation
Quick-entry priority levels (Routine / Urgent / Emergent)
Callback button to dial patients directly
Follow-up flags so nothing falls through the cracks

OnCall Scribe is designed for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who take call and receive patient triage messages via text or pager. It's a documentation tool for healthcare professionals — not a patient-facing app.

Summary
OnCall Scribe does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or patient health information. All data you enter into the app remains exclusively on your device.
Data Storage
All triage records, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your iPhone using Apple's SwiftData framework. Data is encrypted at rest using iOS file protection (NSFileProtectionComplete), meaning it is encrypted whenever your device is locked.
No data is stored on external servers, cloud services, or any third-party infrastructure.
Data Collection
OnCall Scribe collects no data whatsoever. Specifically:

No analytics — We do not track how you use the app
No crash reporting — We do not collect crash logs
No advertising — There are no ads and no ad tracking
No third-party SDKs — The app contains no Facebook, Google, Firebase, or other third-party code
No network calls — The app makes zero internet connections and functions fully offline

AI Processing
OnCall Scribe uses Apple's Foundation Models framework to parse triage messages. This AI processing happens entirely on your device using Apple's on-device language model. No text is sent to Apple, Anthropic, OpenAI, or any other external service for processing.
Data Sharing
When you use the Export feature to share triage records (via email, text message, or other apps), you are explicitly choosing to share that data. OnCall Scribe does not automatically share any data — all sharing is user-initiated.
Data Retention
Your data remains on your device until you delete it. You can delete individual records within the app, or delete all data by uninstalling the app.
HIPAA Compliance
OnCall Scribe is designed with healthcare privacy in mind. Because all data is stored locally and no data is transmitted to any third party, there is no Business Associate Agreement (BAA) required. However, you are responsible for ensuring your use of the app and any exported records complies with your institution's HIPAA policies and procedures.
Children's Privacy
OnCall Scribe is designed for healthcare professionals and is not intended for use by children under 18.
Changes to This Policy
If we update this privacy policy, we will post the new version at this URL and update the "Last Updated" date.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why isn't AI parsing working?
A: AI parsing requires an iPhone 15 Pro or newer with Apple Intelligence enabled. Go to Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri and make sure Apple Intelligence is turned on. The app will use basic pattern matching as a fallback on unsupported devices.
Q: Where is my data stored?
A: All data is stored locally on your iPhone. Nothing is uploaded to the cloud or any external server.
Q: Can I sync between devices?
A: Not currently. To maintain privacy and avoid HIPAA concerns, OnCall Scribe does not include cloud sync. You can export records and transfer them manually if needed.
Q: How do I export my records?
A: Tap the share icon on the main screen, select a date range, and tap Share. You can send the formatted triage log via email, text, AirDrop, or any other sharing method.
Q: I accidentally deleted a record. Can I recover it?
A: Unfortunately, deleted records cannot be recovered. We recommend exporting important records before deleting them.
Q: How do I change my specialty?
A: Go to Settings (gear icon) and tap on Specialty to select a different medical specialty.
Q: Does this app replace my EMR documentation?
A: No. OnCall Scribe is a personal documentation tool to help you track triage encounters during on-call shifts. You should still complete all required documentation in your institution's official medical record system.

App Store Review Notes
(These are private notes to Apple's review team, not shown to users)
OnCall Scribe is a documentation tool for physicians during on-call shifts. 

KEY POINTS FOR REVIEW:

1. MEDICAL CATEGORY: This is a productivity/documentation tool for healthcare 
   professionals, not a diagnostic or treatment app. It does not provide medical 
   advice or patient-facing features.

2. PRIVACY: The app makes zero network connections. All data is stored locally 
   using SwiftData with iOS file protection. No analytics, no third-party SDKs.

3. AI FEATURES: The app uses Apple's Foundation Models framework for on-device 
   text parsing. No data is sent to external AI services.

4. TESTING: To test the core functionality:
   - Go to Settings and select a specialty (e.g., "OB/GYN")
   - Tap + to create a new record
   - Paste this sample triage message: "DR SMITH JANE DOE 713-555-1234 DOB:06/30/1993 NOT OB CONCERNS FOR UTI SYMPTOMS"
   - Observe that the AI parses the message into structured fields
   - Add advice, select a disposition, and save
   - The record appears in the list and can be searched, edited, or deleted

5. DEVICE REQUIREMENT: AI parsing requires iPhone 15 Pro+ with Apple Intelligence 
   enabled. Basic pattern matching works on all devices as a fallback.
