# OnCall Scribe

**Fast, private triage documentation for on-call physicians.**

OnCall Scribe is a native iOS app designed for on-call physicians to capture, organize, search, and share triage messages received during call shifts. Paste an incoming triage message, and the app intelligently parses it into structured fields — patient name, DOB, callback number, attending physician, chief complaint — so you can document your clinical response and move on.

All data is stored exclusively on your device. No servers. No cloud. No ads.

## Features

- **Smart Parsing** — Paste unstructured triage messages and extract structured fields automatically
- **On-Device AI** — Apple Foundation Models parse messages locally with no data leaving your device
- **Specialty Customization** — Tailored fields for OB-GYN, Pediatrics, Family Medicine, Psychiatry, and more
- **Full CRUD** — Create, view, edit, and delete triage records
- **Search & Filters** — Full-text search plus advanced filtering by date, priority, disposition, and follow-up status
- **Export & Share** — Generate formatted triage logs with date range selection or manual record picking
- **Face ID / Touch ID** — Optional biometric app lock for additional security
- **HIPAA-Conscious Design** — Local-only storage, no analytics, no network calls, no third-party SDKs
